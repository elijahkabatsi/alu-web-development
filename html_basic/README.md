# HTML Basic Project

This project introduces the fundamentals of HTML and how webpages are structured and displayed by a browser.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I am able to explain:

- What HTML is
- How to create a basic HTML page
- What a markup language is
- What the DOM (Document Object Model) is
- What HTML elements and tags are
- What HTML attributes are
- How a browser loads and renders a webpage

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `base_index.html` – A basic, valid HTML file with proper structure
- `index.html` – The main webpage containing headings, paragraphs, links, and an image
- `tweets.html` – A secondary webpage containing an embedded tweet
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Requirements

- All files end with a new line
- No external libraries or frameworks are used
- Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are allowed (HTML only in this project)
- All HTML files are W3C compliant and validated
- The website uses semantic HTML structure:
  - `<header>`
  - `<main>`
  - `<article>`
  - `<aside>`
  - `<footer>`

## Navigation

- The header contains navigation links between `index.html` and `tweets.html`
- Each page links back to the other for easy navigation
